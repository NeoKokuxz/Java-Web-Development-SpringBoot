# Data Sources

## Data Source vs. DataSource
- Data source
  - A source of data, such as database
- DataSource
  - Java utility class that manages connections to physical or logical databases
- In particular, Spring injects a Hikari DataSource by default for JDBC connections, which is a lightweight JDBC DataSource that supports connection pooling.

### DataSource
> Java utility class that manages connections to physical or logical databases

#### Basic DataSource
> Produces Connection objects

#### Connection-Pooling DataSource
> Pools Connection objects to maintain a list of open connections and reuse closed connections

#### Distributed Transaction DataSource
> Uses transaction manager to manage distributed requests oftern pools connections as well

## Database URL structure
- jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/exampledb
- subprotocol // serverName[:port] / databaseInstanceName: properties

## Configure Spring with MySQL
- Configure application.properties
```java
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:3306/plant
spring.datasource.username=sa // can be any username
spring.datasource.password=sa1234 // can be any password
```
- Configure dependency in pom file
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
- SQL execution
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA `plant` ; -- Create the plant database

CREATE USER 'sa'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'sa1234'; -- Create the user if you havenâ€™t yet
GRANT ALL ON plant.* TO 'sa'@'localhost'; -- Gives all privileges to the new user on plant
```
