# Jenkins

## Jenkins - Introduction
> Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in the Java programming language. Jenkins helps to automate a few aspects related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. There are many more other frameworks available in the market, as listed here.

In our case, we need to integrate Jenkins with AWS to trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically whenever code changes pushed to our GitHub repository. This automation would require us to link our Git repository to Jenkins.

More information about Jenkins is available [here] (https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/). Refer the diagram below to understand where does the Jenkins fit into the overall system.
