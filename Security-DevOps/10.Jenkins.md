# Jenkins

## Jenkins - Introduction
> Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in the Java programming language. Jenkins helps to automate a few aspects related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. There are many more other frameworks available in the market, as listed here.

In our case, we need to integrate Jenkins with AWS to trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically whenever code changes pushed to our GitHub repository. This automation would require us to link our Git repository to Jenkins.

More information about Jenkins is available [here] (https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/). Refer the diagram below to understand where does the Jenkins fit into the overall system.

## Jenkins Pipeline

## Prerequisite to Install Jenkins
> You can install Jenkins if your system has either of the following prerequisites:

- Native system packages,
- Docker, or
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available on it.


## What is Jenkinsfile?
> A Jenkins Pipeline is defined using a text file called Jenkinsfile. This text file is stored in the application’s Source Control Repository e.g., Github. Storing the Jenkinsfile into a source control repository makes it possible to review and audit collaboratively. A Jenkinsfile can be written using either of the two types of syntax - Declarative and Scripted. The following is an example file:

```
Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent { docker { image 'maven:3.3.3' } }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## Logging into Jenkins (GUI) installed on EC2 Instance
These steps will help you follow the consolidated video on the next page.

Go to the AWS dashboard to copy the public IP address of your Linux EC2 instance.
Paste the public IP address into your browser, appended with :8080 port. For the first time, it will open up the Jenkins GUI as shown in the snapshot below:

On the terminal, where you have connected to the Linux EC2 instance, and entered the shell into Jenkins using docker exec -it jenkins bash, view the content of the file using the command sudo cat <path copied in the previous step>. It will show the default administrator password. You can copy and use this password in the GUI (browser) to log in the first time.

After successful login, you may choose to install default plugins. Though, we will learn to use specific plugins for our needs in the next lesson. See the snapshot below.

If you choose to install suggested plugins, the following plugins would get installed. See the snapshot below:

Set up the user credentials. See the snapshot below:

Next, it will show you a success message and take you to the Jenkins dashboard.

## Install Jenkins on Linux Instance
The following are the steps to install Jenkins, as mentioned in the official Reference manual for installing Jenkins on Linux machines, if you wish to do it locally.
```
# Step 1 - Update existing packages
sudo apt-get update

# Step 2 - Install Java
sudo apt install -y default-jdk

# Step 3 - Download Jenkins package. 
# You can go to http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/ to see the available commands
# First, add a key to your system
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -

# # Step 4 - Add the following entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list:
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

# # Step 5 -Update your local package index
sudo apt-get update

# Step 6 - Install Jenkins
sudo apt-get install -y jenkins

# Step 7 - Start the Jenkins server
sudo systemctl start jenkins

# Step 8 - Enable the service to load during boot
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
The sudo command allows us to run a command as root. The apt utility is for installing software. It is a package manager and performs dependency resolution to install the supporting libraries for the end user. A package manager facilitates easy installation, upgrading, and management of software on a computer. The -y option for apt enables it to automatically select the “yes” option to install the software and prevents prompting of the end user. You will observe in the step which adds “jenkins.list” that we are adding an additional software repository source from where our Linux computer will be able to install the software. This is referred to as an Apt Package Repo.
