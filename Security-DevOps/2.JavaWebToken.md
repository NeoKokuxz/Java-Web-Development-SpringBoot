# Java Web Token (JWT)
> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard RFC 7519, that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

> JWTs are used for authentication and authorization in Spring Boot applications. RESTful APIs provide this functionality (authentication and authorization).
REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is a software-architectural style, in which there is a stateless communication between client and server.

> Stateless means that the server does not have to store the user cookies or other session data for any incoming request. Rather, the server authenticates a user based on JWT.

> RESTful APIs help to keep clients and server independent from each other. This way, a client from any platform (Java, .net, PHP, Android, or any other) can communicate (or request a resource) to the server having REST API endpoints.
