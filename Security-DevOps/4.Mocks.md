## Mock Objects
A mock object is a "fake" object that allows us to dictate its behavior in different situations

* Few important methods and annotations provided by Mockito are:
mock()/@Mock - To create mock object. Here, mock() is an overloaded static method which accepts Class<T> classToMock as an argument and correspondingly returns a mock instance.

when()/given() - To specify the behaviour of mock object. when() method takes a particular method X as argument and set the expected (mocked) return value as Y. Following are the few examples:
```
when(mock.someMethod()).thenReturn(200); 
//parameterized methods as argument
when(mock.someMethod(anyString())).thenReturn(200); 
//throw an exception 
when(mock.someMethod("some argument")).thenThrow(new RuntimeException());
```
spy()/ @Spy - It is used for partial mocking. It means that the real methods are invoked but still can be verified and stubbed.
There are few more methods and annotations available, such as @InjectMocks, verify()
Note that if a project contains private methods to test, then we can't use Mockito as it does not mock private methods. Mockito assumes that private methods don't exist from the viewpoint of testing.

There are few other mocking frameworks available for Java, such as JMock, EasyMock, and Powermock. It is a matter of choice of the developer based on preferences such as Powermock can even mock private methods.
