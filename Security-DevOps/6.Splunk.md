# Splunk

## What is Splunk?
> Splunk is a search engine for IT data that was created to analyze machine-generated data. We encourage you to read the official documentation to get a clear insight of the Splunk and its capabilities.

## Machine-generated data
> Machine-generated data refers to the data generated by application logs, server logs, network devices, sensors, IoT, cloud services, or mobile services. The data could be structured or unstructured.

- Structured data has clearly defined data-types and a particular pattern e.g., relational data. It resides in a database, on which we can run queries.
- Unstructured data has no specific pattern e.g., textual log messages, reviews on the eCommerce platform.

## Challenges without Splunk
>Machine-generated data is challenging to analyze because:

- Its volume is high
- Sometimes it is unstructured, thus requires a pre-processing

## Benefits
> Splunk helps generate information from machine-generated data and provides insights quickly. It helps to scale the data input limitlessly. It also provides machine learning capabilities to build auto-alert systems. Splunk helps the user to leverage machine-generated data in gauging the system performance, investigating the failure conditions, developing the business matrix, data visualization, and many more benefits.

## Deployment Meodels
- Search Head
  - Responds to a search request
- Indexer
  - Converts the forwarder's raw data  into events and indexes it into a bucket
- Forwarder(2 types: Universal or Heavy)
  - Forwards raw data
  
## Deployment Topology
> There could be different deployment topology based on the requirements of the project. The following are the examples:

- Single host - independent search heads manage searches for a group of independent indexers.
- High Availability - a group of indexers replicate data among themselves to ensure high data availability.
- Multiple data store clustering - a group of search heads share search management responsibilities.
- Multiple datastore peering - common in larger deployments. It is similar to the pattern of high availability, except that the search management function is handled by a search head cluster instead of individual search heads.
