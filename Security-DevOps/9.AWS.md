# AWS Setup Instructions
1. Create an AWS Account - Open a free-tier AWS account (if you don't already have one) following the instructions via the Amazon Web Service Help Center. https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/
2. Learn to Launch, and Connect to your Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Instances - EC2 instances are the virtual machines (VMs) with user-defined configuration. Try launching a sample EC2 instance by following the instruction given in the official documentation. You can launch an instance in 7 simple steps, as follows:
- Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - An AMI is a template used to create a VM. AMI contains the pre-installed operating system, application server, and applications required to launch your instance. In this lesson, we will use Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03 while launching the instance.
- Choose an Instance Type - Instance Type offers varying combinations of CPUs, memory (GB), storage (GB), types of network performance, and availability of IPv6 support. AWS offers a variety of Instance Types, broadly categorized in 5 categories. You can choose any one of those types supported by a free tier account.
- Configure Instance Details - Provide the instance count and configuration details, such as network, subnet, behavior, monitoring, etc.
- Add Storage - You can choose to attach either SSD or Standard Magnetic drive to your instance.
- Add Tags - A tag serves as a label that you can attach to multiple AWS resources, such as volumes, instances, or both.
- Configure Security Group - Attach a set of firewall rules to your instance(s) that controls the incoming traffic to your instance(s).
- Review - Review your instance launch details before the launch.
