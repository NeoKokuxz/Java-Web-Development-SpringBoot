# Authentication and Authorization

## What is Authentication?
> Authentication confirms your identity. It is a process that proves that you are the person who you say you are. In the digital world, the most common way to authenticate is to use a username and password. For example, while logging into your eCommerce account, you prove your identity by providing an email and a password, sometimes followed by an OTP or a second factor. There are many other ways to authenticate, and these are depicted in the figure below.
