# Web Services and APIs

# Web Services
share data between two disparate systems or way to retrieve data to display in your application.

## Client
The Client makes a request for data

## Server
Server will respond to the client's request

## Standard Web Protocol HTTP
- Format
  - JSON
    - JavaScript Object Notation
    - Key - Value Pairs
  - XML
    - Extensible Markup Language
    
## Reusability & Usability
this concept allows organizations to use web services provided by third parties. This reduces development time and delivers more powerful applications.

# APIs & Microservices
More lightweight than web service 
- APIs
  - SOAP
  - RESTful APIs
- Microservices
  - Similar to API
  - Fully contained
  - individual component

## SOAP 
Simple Object Access Protocol 

# RESTful APIs
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer
-Data & Functionality are the resouces in API and identified through something called the URI
  - URI - Uniform Resource Identifier
  - manipulate with a fixed set of operations
    - GET, retrieve the resources 
    - POST, send in the resources
    - PUT, update the resources
    - DELETE, delete the resources
    
## Entity
This marks a Java class as an entity, which means it will be persisted to the database. Typically, an entity maps to a database table and the table contains rows that represent that given entity.
- @Entity - defined by this annotation
```java
@Entity
public class Location {
    //Id is unique identifier (primary key)
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) //Type can be: AUTO/TABLE/SEQUENCE/IDENTITY
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String address;

    //Constructor
    public Location(Long id, String name, String address) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }
 }
```

## RestController
This marks a class as a REST API.
- @RestController is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.

## GetMapping
This annotation handles HTTP GET requests and acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.GET).
```java
    @GetMapping("/location")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Location>> getAllLocation(){
        List<Location> list = locationService.retrieveLocations();
        return new ResponseEntity<>(list, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
```

# GraphQL APIs
- Web application
- Query language for APIs (Describes how to ask for data
- Flexibility
- graphql-spring-boot-starter - configure a GraphQL Servlet that you can access at /graphql
- graphql-java-tools - A helper library to parse the GraphQL schema.
- Schema
  - Define data points
  - Data type
  - Relationships
  - Operations
  - Queries & mutations
```GraphQL
type Location {
 id: ID!
 name: String!
 address: String!
}

type Query {
 findAllLocations: [Location]!
}

type Mutation {
 newLocation(name: String!, address: String) : Location!
 deleteLocation(id:ID!) : Boolean
 updateLocationName(newName: String!, id:ID!) : Location!
}
```
